>> the time complexity of common bruteforce techniques is O(nm), which n the length of string/elements that i want to search for, m the entire string/elements
- sometimes also be O(n^2)
O(m*n) refers to the runnning time of the boyer-moore-horspool Algorithm, which finds all the occurrences of a substring in a string.
 Python's str.find Method finds only one occurrence of the substring, so it's (str.find) will depend on the position of the first occurrence of substring.

>> quadrtic vs cubic :
in maximum subarray algorithm u may think your using the quadrtic but in the fact your using qubic to make your algo is quadrtic u should do the following:
to calc the maximum slice, instead back to the first and calc  them and u already did that, so use the previouse result instead of go from the first element to get quadrtic,
if u back to the first element u algo will gonna be a cubic
