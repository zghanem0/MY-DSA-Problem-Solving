# Main Differences

```
- dynamic programming move through each element and (either pick it then use at later on for the next computation  ,or leave it )
- greedy algo (gready choice): is alittle bit diff, instead of move through each element, it will find the most optimum solution using by your intuation (that is why is called greedy), example of gready algo when u have a google map u have many paths to the same destination the algo algorithem make the best path in blue and the others are in grey in google map  have many paths within specific creterias

# Greedy algo characterstics (gready choice): this is the maximum(gready)  choice or  this is the most minimum(gready) cost 
- heuristic : works in some cases and some doesn't, there many many choices u have to choose the best and undr every choice there many other choices u need to choose what look like the best choice and so on that is why is called gready algo. sth like positional play in the chess. choosing the best choice of the current step making my choice or position is the best
- is all about choose tha best solution from all of the others depends on specific parameters/criteria
