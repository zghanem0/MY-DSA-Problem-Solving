Python Special Functions: http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names
Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions in Python.

>  __init__(): is one of them. It gets called every time we create a new object of that class.

> __str__(): method in our class that controls how the object gets printed, __str__()  == str(p1)

p1 = Point(2,3)
print(p1)
<__main__.Point object at 0x00000000031F8CC0>


Suppose we want the print() function to print the coordinates of the Point object instead of what we got. We can define a __str__() . Let's look at how we can achieve this:

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x,self.y)

Output
(2, 3)
        
-  Turns out, that this same method is invoked when we use the built-in function str() or format().
