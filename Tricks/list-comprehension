>>> there are 2 styles must follows
1- the general
[unicode(x.strip()) if x is not None else '' for x in row]

2- if i have "if" and "and" or "or" operations only wihtout else
[f(x) for x in sequence if condition and condition or condition]


########### EXAMPLE ##########
logs = """ahmed=10
ghanem=15
ayman=25
abd=20
ghanem=15
ayman=25"""
seen = []
# 1- split and remove the duplicate lines  
#             [will do it                              if all of the rest became true otherwise will noting will be applied]
print(seen.append("test")
sorted_list = [i.split('=') for i in logs.splitlines() if i not in seen and not seen.append(i)]
# what about the "not" here ?                                                   NONE  < this is the returned value of this oepration "seen.append(i)" u can check it by : print(seen.append("test") that is why say "not")
print(not None == True  == "balah" == "anything else rather than None")

# 2- then sort them depends of key 
sorted_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
# 3- then join 
print("\n".join(['='.join(i) for i in sorted_list ]))
