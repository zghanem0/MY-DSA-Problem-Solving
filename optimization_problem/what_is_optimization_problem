> is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions.
- Optimization problems can be divided into two categories, depending on whether the variables are continuous or discrete:

> An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a discrete optimization, in which an object such as an integer, permutation or graph must be found from a countable set.
A problem with continuous variables is known as a continuous optimization, in which an optimal value from a continuous function must be found. They can include constrained problems and multimodal problems.


> what is the difference between dynamic programing and gready algorithm.
```
While a Greedy Algorithm is usually called naive, because it may run multiple times over the same set of data, Dynamic Programming avoids this pitfall through a deeper understanding of the partial results that must be stored to help build the final solution.

- dynamic programming move through each element and (either pick it then use at later on for the next computation  ,or leave it )
- greedy algo: is alittle bit diff, instead of move through each element, it will find the most optimum solution using by your intuation (that is why is called greedy), example of gready algo when u have a google map u have many paths to the same destination the algo algorithem make the best path in blue and the others are in grey in google map  have many paths.

# Greedy algo characterstics: (gready choice)
- heuristic : works in some cases and some doesn't, there many many choices u have to choose the best and undr every choice there many other choices u need to choose what look like the best choice and so on that is why is called gready algo. sth like positional play in the chess. choosing the best choice of the current step making my choice or position is the best
- is all about choose tha best solution from all of the others depends on specific parameters/criteria 

```

>>> summary:
u have many solutions to solve a problem and the problem/job is finding the optimum solution.
so Optimization problem usually about finding Maximum something or Minimum something like, Max profit ot Min cost.
