>> there are 2 types of dorting mechnism :
    - Comparison Sort : O(n^2)
        - Bubble sort : for Education
        - insertion sort:when the list is small and nearly sorted or presorted list
        - selection sort: for Education
        - merge sort: Devide and Conquer Techniqe
        - quick sort: pivoting , Devide and Conquer Techniqes
        - timsort: python using timesort as a build-in sort algorithm
! can we beat the O(n^2)?? yes there are Non-Comparison Sort but working only with numbers specifically integers type only
    - Non-Comparison Sort: O(n log n)
        - Counting Sort
        - Radix Sort

>> what we need and use in the real life:
    - Comparison Sort:
        - insertion sort: it's bearly used and used when the list is small and nearly sorted ,no need for alot of sorts
        - Quick Sort : can sort in place, used when u care about the space complexty and can pick a good pivot and average case matters(happened) more than the worst case
        - Merge Sort : used when i want to accelarate the search because it's using the memory
    - Non-Comparison Sort: working only with numbers specifically integers type only
        - Counting Sort :
        - Radix Sort :
        - timsort: python using timesort as a build-in sort algorithm
